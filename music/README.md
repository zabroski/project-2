#-why this project for you?

    I chose to build this project because I enjoy music.  Music is a large part of my life.  It is everthing for me. I know that many people love music and can relate to my love of music.  I assume most people in this world listen to music everday and would like to know more about artists. This app will help users to find out their favorite artists infomation.


#-how would a user (not you) approach this project if using it in the wild (i.e. how would a player play your game).

    The user can go onto the internet and find the app. In the future the user can listen to thier favoirte artists audio.  Users can also find this app in github.   

## technologies & packages
    In this app I used HTML , JAVASCRIPT, CSS in REACT.JS.
    I used API to get the artist data to display it as well. 


## launch/build 
#-how do you run the game for users who clone your repo. 

    Users have to clone the repository from github and open the index.html file.
    Use can receive a link of the app.  


## major problems & solutions
    I had an issue at the beginning of my project,  and to solve this problem I had to switch an API because it wasn't responding as I wanted it to. 


## MVP

    Setup Up initial Routes and Links
    I use music API.
    CSS animation and to style the project
