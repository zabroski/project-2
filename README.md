# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to show your project to your instructors and classmates in a five minute presentation in front of the class. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking about your code.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements

#### Your website must:

- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include data from a third-party API.  
    - Pull data into the application using an API  
        [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
        [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  
	[Instructor Recommended APIs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-bananas/apis)
    - TRY OUT your API in the browser by making an axios request before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it does...**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW US YOU CAN RECEIVE THE DATA FOR YOUR PROPOSAL**
- Use React Router installed using npm.
- Have at least 6 separate components, using a readable file structure.
- Be built using Create React App.
- Be styled with CSS.
- Use flexbox layout or CSS Grid.
- Use functional components and class components appropriately.  
- Be deployed via GitHub and Surge.    

- **Optionally, you may incorporate a component library to design your app with approval**

#### Your code must:

- Be properly indented.  
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names.  
- Be written with kebab-case (dashes) CSS class names.  
- Contain no `console.log()` or commented out code in final version.  
- Use only React for DOM manipulation.  
- No pre-loaded `create-react-app` files or code.

#### Your README must include:

- Name of your project.   
- Brief description of the project.  
- A link to your deployed project.  
- Images of your wireframe and component hierarchy.  
- A code snippet.  
- User stories.  

Example of a [Project Worksheet](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-bananas/project-1/blob/master/ProjectWorksheet.md)

## Necessary Deliverables

#### For the proposal:
- A collection of wireframes - hand-drawn or digitally created - outlining the important pages of your site, as well as the critical states of your project, drawing a component hierarchy would be a great way to indicate which components need state and which components need props.
- A proposal including:
	- A description of the project you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.
	- An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this app.
	- An explanation of how you foresee yourself solving the aforementioned problems.
	- A visual of your component hierarchy.  
	- A link to the API you plan to use.  
	- A section clearly defining MVP and POST MVP.
	- If you plan on incorporating a component library, include a link in your proposal.  

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
