# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of. You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements

#### Proposal (Due Date: 07/29/19):
- A description of the app you'll be building
- A wireframe (hand-drawn or digitally created) of your app (think how the UX folks created their wireframe)
- A diagram of your component hierarchy

#### Your project must be deployed and completed by **Friday, August 2nd at 9:00 AM**.

#### Your app must:
- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include atleast one data from a third-party API.
    - Pull data into the application using an API
        - [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
        - [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)
	- [Instructor Recommended APIs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-cicadas/apis)
    - TRY OUT your API by pasting the endpoint in the browser , or making a postman/insomnia request before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it does... **YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW US YOU CAN RECEIVE THE DATA FOR YOUR PROPOSAL**
- Use React Router installed using `npm install react-router-dom -g`.
- Use Axios
- Have at least 6 separate components, using a readable file structure.
- Be built using Create React App.
- Be styled with CSS (should look professional)
- Adhere to a [color palatte](https://mycolor.space)
- Use flexbox or (CSS Grid) for layout and positioning
- Use functional components and class components appropriately.
- Be deployed via Surge.

#### Your code must:
- Be on github.com
- Be properly indented. *cough* ESLint *cough*
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names
- Be written with kebab-case CSS class names (e.g. this-is-the-class-name)
- No `console.log()` or commented out code in final version
- Use correct folder structure for components and make sure that you name your main component
  file index.js. This allows us to do:<br/>
  `import Header from './src/components/Header'`<br/>
  instead of:<br/>
  `import Header from './src/components/Header/Header`<br/>

```
Example:
src
|__components
|  |__Header
|  |  |__index.js
|  |  |__Header.css
|  |
|  |__Footer
|     |__index.js
|     |__Footer.css
|
App.js
App.css
index.js
```


#### Create a nice README that includes:
- Name of your project
- Brief description of your app
- Screenshot/video of your project
- A link to your deployed app

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
